              <!-- Replace Patch to Image Under -->
              <p>I have learned this hard that no matter how persistent you are, you will never succeed until and unless you have a purpose. It is the same thought that derives my content strategy. I dissect the goal of each campaign before planning it - who is the target audience, its geo-location, race, age, gender, religion, culture, traditions, hobbies, ambitions, likes and dislikes, and more that shapes a person into an individual. It gives me an ideal persona that helps me plan the content to answer all the possible queries that they may have regarding the products/service I am marketing.</p>

              <h3>On-Page & Off-Page SEO</h3>
              <!-- Replace Patch to Image Under -->
<p> SEO is not merely building a brand organically. It is so much more. You are working for some of the biggest tech giants, Google & Bing, to convince them to list your product or service for free on their platform. It needs months (even years) of hard work, dedication, and brilliance to make these search engines your friend. I believe I have made put the base of our friendship if not turned them into my BFFs. I work on planning and executing Technical SEO that includes generating XML sitemaps, creating Robots.txt, working on 301 redirections, fixing 404 pages, laying an SEO-friendly website structure and hierarchy, improving UI/UX, amplifying page speed, internal linking, defining canonicals, alt tags, hreflang tags, meta tags, etc. I also work on Content SEO that includes doing keyword research, identifying the right content messaging, creating a brand voice, and ensuring consistency while avoiding cannibalization, plagiarism, and internal duplication. I am an expert in Outreaching and Link Building as well and have been able to get links and building networks with HQ websites such as Forbes, CIO, Career Karma, Training Industry, etc. </p>            </div>

          <!-- Replace About Us Text Under -->
          <p>I am a digital marketer who believes that the right content promoted on the right platform at the right time is the key to success. <br><br>
            I live by the quote of David Tyreman that says,
            A business designed to chase the almighty dollar will lose sight of its authenticity and eventually become irrelevant.
            This quote by David is my mantra. I help businesses to promote and sell their products and services to customers via the organic medium. 
            My expertise is to create a brand reputation in the market using various content marketing strategies. My goal in life is to provide value and not just sell the product. 
            I am a strategic planner, a critical thinker, and a project manager who knows how to communicate effectively and collaborate successfully.
